# Stylish Image Box Generator 

Styling pictures The Right Way!

# Motivation 

One of the pain points i wanted to fix is to make a application
that is fun for the use to see moving images based on animations and also for
the use can dynamically change the pictures based on what the user want 
look like.


# Api Made Easy Team 

Michael Francois


# Features

The program uses the Unsplash API to get data and then displays photos of the results. The image details are displayed, and the user can alter them using input siders and drag-and-drop functionality. The user can select the type of picture they want to produce from the application's side menu. It might be a two-dimensional image or a three-dimensional cube image.

 It's possible to select rotation type, easing, prism dimensions, background colors, 
 and other properties.
